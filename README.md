# Hello there, I'm Josh


I'm working on building practical, security-minded tech projects that delve into understanding systems, strengthening infrastructure, and making operations run smoother.

Most of my work is hands-on: real configurations, real logs, and real experiments across networking, cybersecurity, automation, and system analysis. I focus on breaking down complex technical processes into clear, repeatable steps that others can use right away.

I come from a background spanning finance, legal, and healthcare, where I learned how to make workflows efficient, teach others to use technology confidently, and support cross-functional teams. I enjoy solving problems that make a meaningful difference in how systems operate and how securely they run.

I plan to use my GitHub to share clean walkthroughs, beginner-friendly security labs, and intermediate-to-advanced setups that show how networks behave, how vulnerabilities emerge, and how to defend against them.

## What I plan to work on
🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects: packet sniffing, firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection, vulnerability scanning

🌐 Networking Labs: protocol analysis, traffic monitoring, wireless network security

🔐 Security Hardening: OWASP Top 10 mitigation, password security, log analysis

📊 Operational Improvements: automation scripts, troubleshooting tools, system diagnostics

📚 Educational Walkthroughs: step-by-step guides for beginners learning security concepts

⚙️ Hands-on Experiments: ethical penetration tests, honeypots, SIEM-lite ML models

🧰 Tooling: Wireshark, Scapy, Snort, Suricata, OpenVAS, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux
